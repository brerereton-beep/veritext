# VeriText Privacy Policy

VeriText does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

All text analysis is performed directly between the user’s browser and the OpenAI API using the user’s own API key.

API keys are stored locally on the user’s device using Chrome’s local storage and are never transmitted to any third party other than OpenAI.

No browsing history, personal information, or user content is logged or retained by VeriText.

Clipboard access is only used when the user explicitly clicks “Paste clipboard”.

VeriText does not use analytics, tracking pixels, or third-party telemetry.
